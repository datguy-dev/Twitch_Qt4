# Twitch_Qt4
  Twitch_Qt4 is a desktop application developed solely for Linux, using Python 2 and PyQt4, that assists with the viewing of live streams that are hosted on Twitch.tv. This app will pull a list of the streams you follow using Twitch's offical Kraken API, then interface streamlink to your preferred media player. Twitch_Qt4 is a lightweight application that is intended to avoid the resource usage and connection issues that can otherwise occur while watching Twitch with a browser.
  
  Twitch_Qt4 is currently in the pre-alpha stage. If you wish to test it, we'd be glad to hear about your expierencing and or issues.
